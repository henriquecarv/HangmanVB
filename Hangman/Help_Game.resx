    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Description :

Hangman is a game with a thousand words available for the players, providing a lot of fun between friends, with family, wherever you can have access to a PC with windows. The main point of this game is to test the abilities of the user with his knowledge about the words in the different categories within the game.

The system has been built in Visual Basic Language, using the Microsoft Tools: Visual Studio 2008 and 2013 Express Edition, for the database the software utilized was the Microsoft Office Access 2013.


Our group set out to create a hangman game that was accessible to anyone on a computer looking to kill some time. We came up with a few ideas to ensure that our hangman was slightly different than the majority you come across on the web. When you run the program the first thing that happens is that a window will open. In this window are brief instructions and two buttons, a start button and an exit button. Once you click start you are presented with a new window which will allow you to choose both a category and difficulty from receptive drop down boxes. The words you will get in game will be associated with your chosen category randomly selected from our large database of words, while the difficulty chosen will impact the number of incorrect guesses you're allowed before losing. Once you have selected both you click the play button at the bottom of the screen to begin your game. When the game screen opens there will be several different components. The category you chose along with the difficulty will be displayed on the upper right had side of the screen. Clicking the letter buttons at the bottom will input your guess. Once you have clicked one of two things will happen. If the letter is in the word the letter will appear in the correct location over the blank lines. If your guess is incorrect a segment of the picture will be drawn and the letter you guessed will show up in the incorrect guess box on the bottom right of the screen. The game continues in this fashion until either you complete the word for a win, or guess incorrectly the number of times determined by your difficulty, completing the drawing indicating a loss.


FAQs

What happens if I click the same letter twice?

It can't happen. Once a letter has been clicked it is disabled for the remainder of the round, ensuring that you don’t spend more than one guess on each letter.


How will I know when I lost?

A pop up window will open with the message “Nice try! Better luck next time.”


Do I need anything special on my computer to run the program?

The only additional thing you need downloaded on your machine is the word database, which is where the program pulls the random selected words from.


How many times may I start new games?

As many times as you like.


Will I get the same word twice?

Possible but unlikely as we have provided a rather larger pool of words to choose from.
